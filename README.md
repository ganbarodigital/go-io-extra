## Why Use ioextra?

_ioextra_ contains helpful, reusable input/output types and utilities. We've extracted them and refined them from our other Golang code.

We hope you find them useful too.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To start using _ioextra_, install Go v1.17 or above. Then, import _ioextra_ into your Golang code:

```sh
import ioextra "github.com/ganbarodigital/go-ioextra"
```

This will retrieve the library.

## Versioning

For ease of maintenance, we keep each major release in separate sub-folders. This makes it very easy for us, if we ever need to release a bug fix or security fix for an older version.
